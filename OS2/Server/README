This is the osFree OS/2 personality, the set of services implementing
the OS/2 API. It currently has implementations for L4Env and Genode.

You should checkout osFree sources first:

# mkdir osfree
# cd osfree
# svn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/osfree/code/trunk .

create a symlink for osfree/OS2/Server (under the "os3" name):

# cd ..
# ln -s osfree/OS2/Server os3

Then build the corresponding environment and OS/2 personality
sources, based on it:

For L4Env build, look into ./platform/l4env (some functionality is working).
For L4Re build, look into ./platform/l4re (only a stub for now).
For Genode build, look into ./platform/genode (incomplete, yet).

Look into README file in the corresponding environment specific
directory for further instructions.
