This is an L4Env-specific sources and build system for osFree OS/2
personality. To build it under L4Env, you should checkout L4Env sources
first:

# svn co http://svn.tudos.org/repos/tudos/trunk .

To compile the L4Env sources under newer Linuxes, you'll need to run toolchain
from Debian 5 "Lenny". So, you'll need to install Debian 5 "Lenny" in chroot.
For that, use the addendum at the end of this README.

Then create the L4Env build dir:

# mkdir bld
# cd l4
# make O=../bld config

Customize your options in the started ncurses-based TUI. You may need to disable
building the documentation, for example. Documentation requires texlive to build
the PDF files from .tex source.

Then change to the build directory and run make:

# cd bld
# make

This will build everything, including L4Env and L4/Fiasco microkernel.

Then create a symlink to "os3/src/env/l4env" directory in l4/pkg directory:

# cd ..
# cd l4/pkg
# ln -s ../../../os3/src/env/l4env os3

Change to os3/src/env/l4env:

# cd ../../..
# cd os3/src/env/l4env

Edit the build.cfg file. Change the top level dir, where "osfree", "os3", "l4",
"kernel" and "bld" dirs are.

ROOT=/mnt

Then you need to adjust the paths to "os3", "l4", "bld" and "kernel/fiasco/build",
if required. Also, you can adjust the

DISPLAY = -vnc 172.30.0.107:2

setting to point to your QEMU VNC display (if appropriate). I am working on my OS/2 machine,
and I am logging into my Linux machine via SSH, and run make via SSH. I connect to QEMU VNC
display via a VNC viewer. If you run QEMU without VNC, just uncomment the following line

DISPLAY = 

and comment the

DISPLAY = -vnc 172.30.0.107:2

line.

Go to the build dir and run make again:

# cd bld
# make

This should build everything, including the osFree OS/2 personality. Also, you can
change to the required directory and run make with path to the build directory, specified
as a parameter:

# cd ..
# cd os3
# cd src/env/l4env
# cd src/server/os2srv
# make O=/mnt/bld

This will build os2srv only.

Then you can test the built binaries in QEMU with the following command:

# make O=/mnt/bld run

Connect to 172.30.0.107:2 VNC server with your VNC viewer, to see your QEMU screen (if you
enabled VNC).

Setting up the Debian 5 "Lenny" chroot.
--------------------------------------

The Debian "Lenny" is available as a ready to use archive:

# cd /mnt/os2l/src/l4/l4env

Here is the directory where all "osfree", "os3", "l4", "kernel", "bld" subdirectories
are located.

# wget ftp://osfree.org/upload/debian5-i386-chrooted-bldenv.tgz
# tar xvzf debian5-i386-chrooted-bldenv.tgz
# cd debian-lenny-32

Then create bindings for dirs in a chrooted filesystem to corresponding dirs in a root
filesystem:

# mount -o bind /dev/ ./dev/
# mount -o bind /dev/shm/ ./dev/shm/
# mount -o bind /dev/pts/ ./dev/pts/
# mount -o bind /proc/ ./proc/
# mount -o bind /sys/ ./sys/
# mount -o bind /tmp/ ./tmp/
# mount -o bind /mnt/os2l/src/l4/l4env/ ./mnt/

Where /mnt/os2l/src/l4/l4env is the path to your top-level sources directory (containing
the "bld", "l4", "kernel", "osfree" and "os3" subdirs).

Then change into chroot via a command:

# chroot .

You can optionally start "mc" for your convenience:

# mc

You will see the chrooted environment as your root directory. Then you can change to your sources
directory:

# cd /mnt

You will see contents of your /mnt/os2l/src/l4/l4env source directory in /mnt. Here. you can run
your L4Env build system.

# cd bld
# make

-- to build everything. Or

# cd os3
# cd src/env/l4env
# cd src/server/os2srv
# make O=/mnt/bld

then os2srv sources will be built. Or

# make O=/mnt/bld run

will run your OS/2 personality binaries in QEMU.

Note that you could make a chrooted Debian "Lenny" environment yourself from scratch, via
the "debootstrap" script, like this:

# apt-get install debootstrap
# mkdir debian-lenny-32
# cd debian-lenny-32
# debootstrap --arch=i386 --no-check-gpg lenny . http://archive.debian.org/debian

This will download and install the minimal system into the debian-lenny-32 subdirectory. Then
you can chroot into it and install all required additional packages with APT. (add a line
like this:

deb http://archive.debian.org/debian lenny main

to your debian-lenny-32/etc/apt/sources.list file) to have your Debian Lenny repository configured.
