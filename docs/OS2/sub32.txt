32-bit base subsystem
=====================

Intro
-----

In all versions of OS/2 some core API's (VIO, MOU, MON and KBD) still 16-bit.
Exists 2 32-bit API versions for IA-32 OS/2. One is EMXWRAP which actually
provides only wrappers to 16-bit functions (but no thunking support required
from compiler side) and con1632.dll. We selected first ABI because it is more
known. con1632.dll only known in one application. If you require
support for con1632.dll ABI please contact us or implement it by yourself.

Implementation
--------------

All osFree applications links to emxwrap.dll. As result such applications
works fine on original OS/2. osFree module manager replaces emxwrap.dll
import entry to sub32.dll. sub32.dll has same ABI as emxwrap.dll so under
osFree all works as expected too. As result we still have full binary
compatibility for both OS/2 and osFree.
